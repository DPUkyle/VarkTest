The Gosu plugin for IJ is cool, and IJ can manage classpath dependencies well on its own but my projects aren't perfectly portable and have missing JARs.

The Vark build tool, however, can use a Maven POM to manage project dependencies.

This repo will attempt to create a simple Vark build target + a Maven POM.

Essentially I'll try write a "Hello World" Gosu program, but instead of printing to the Console it will use log4j2 to create the output. If Vark+Maven isn't correctly identifying the dependencies, everything will fail.
