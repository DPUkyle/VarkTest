The Gosu plugin for IJ is cool, and IJ can manage classpath dependencies well on its own but my projects aren't perfectly portable.

The Vark build tool, howeven, can use a Maven POM to manage project dependencies.

This repo will attempt to create a simple Vark build target + a Maven POM.

Essentially I'll try write a "Hello World" Gosu program, but instead of printing to the Console it will use log4j2 to create the output.
